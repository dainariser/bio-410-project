Using the Data Visulazation Lab as a base, we tweaked and pulled some information that we wanted to compare. We chose to look at two countries life expectancy rather than every country. We wanted to compare what the life expantancy based on geographical differences.
We downloaded Gapminder and after loading the data from the library we decided to pick two countries Poland and New ealand to compare life expectancies. We plotted it into the ggplot in order to look at the data side by side.

Life expectancy (New Zealand vs Poland)
Looking at the ggplot, the life expatencies are not that different based on the location of the black line based on the box. The data from New Zealand is more skewed compared to the data in Poland. When looking at the data from Poland there were two blue dots representing the outliers.
